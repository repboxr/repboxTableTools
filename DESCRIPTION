Title: Tools to characterize, test and repair extracted tables from articles
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Sebastian Kranz
Maintainer: Sebastian Kranz <sebastian.kranz@uni-ulm.de>
Description: While ExtractSciTab is only about heuristically extracting tables from PDF,
  this package contains helper function to characterize test and repair multiple versions
  of extracted tables (including AI extraction methods). It mainly complements repboxAI.
  To avoid that repboxAI becomes too gluttered, we put this into a separate package.
